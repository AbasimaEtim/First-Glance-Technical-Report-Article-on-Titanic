# Introduction:

This review aims to explore the titanic dataset, identify first glance insights, and suggest potential areas for further analysis where necessary. The Titanic dataset has three different files containing information about passengers on the Titanic ship. This is the stage zero project as a data analyst intern at HNG, I had the opportunity to work with this dataset and also gain valuable experience. To know more about the dataset, vist [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

# Observations:
Observations:

Initial exploration revealed:

1. Survival rate (generally): 62% survived, 38% died (233 females survied and 109 males survived) 
2. Gender distribution: 64% male, 35% female

3. For the Age distribution: the ages of the passengers range from 0.42 to 80 years, also, there are some missing values in the age column.

4. Missing values can be found in the Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns. For the Age column, 177 entries are missed, for the Cabin column there are 687 entries and in the Embarked column, 2 entries are missed.

5. Total number of  those that embarked in Cherbourg 168, Queenstown 77,  Southampton 644

# Conlusion
These initial observations lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive analysis, which could involve examining relationships between variables, addressing missing data, and utilizing statistical models to predict survival. Insights gotten from this preliminary review shows the significance of understandinng the data structure and key variables before undertaking a more in-depth analysis.
